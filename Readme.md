In this example we worked through each SOLID principle, applying them in turn to create modular, maintainable and testable code.

The console app loops through c:\Downloads. It pretends to extract meta-data for a media library and moves music files to c:\Music and video files c:\Videos.

These folders need to exist in order for the app to run.
